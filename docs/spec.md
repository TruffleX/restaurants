## Goal

To build an AI food tour guide based on deep understanding of user preferences.

## Use Case

I love food and my favorite part of traveling to a new city, or exploring a
familiar city, is discovering amazing food. Unfortunately, it's not always
easy to understand what the most exciting opportunities are for my specific
tastes. Guides can often be tarnished by hype, or compromise authenticity by
driving too much tourism. I would love to have an intelligent, dynamic, and
deeply understanding food guide highly refined to my palate and preferences.

## Data Sources

* Yelp
* Wikipedia for semantic analysis
* Food magazines in each city (start with LA and Boston)
* Newspapers in each city if not behind paywall
* Serious Eats to help populate the global space of food
* All Recipes for ingredient coocurrance

## Ideas

* Embed users in ingredient space
* Bayesian reranking of recommendations based on features like environmental
preferences, preferred times, locations, etc.
* Semantically tag restaurants via wiki as a pseudo-knowledge base
